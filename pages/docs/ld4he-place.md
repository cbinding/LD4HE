# Place
***

A named location associated with some aspect of the [investigative activities](ld4he-investigation.md). For example [report publication](ld4he-report-publication.md) will usually name the place of publication (e.g. "Aberdeen"). An [investigation](ld4he-investigation.md) takes place on a [site](ld4he-site.md) (which is itself a named place) - the site will then fall within a broader named place (e.g. "Aberdeen"). A place may be known by more than one name, possibly in more than one language (e.g. "Cardiff"@en, "Caerdydd"@cy).
