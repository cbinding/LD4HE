# Linked Data for the Historic Environment (LD4HE)

## Project aims
The purpose of the LD4HE project is to increase the potential for exchange and reuse of historic environment data. The project has the following primary aims and objectives:

* To create a mapping from mandatory OASIS fields to CIDOC-CRM.
* To create a simple means of converting an OASIS data export to a Linked Data compatible format.
* To determine criteria for establishing which records should be included in Linked Data export.
* To recommend potential for creation and usage of Linked Data.

## Project scope
The LD4HE project scope is to create the capacity for mandatory OASIS metadata (see [list of mandatory fields](ld4he-fields.md)) to be exported in a Linked Data compatible format.This is mapping and export only, with no intention (at this stage) to make the output data publicly available (thus not Linked *Open* Data). There are no current plans for hosting the output data within a publicly available triple store. 

The LD4HE project will allow questions such as the following examples to be answered accurately:

* How many [reports](ld4he-report.md) have been produced with evidence of Roman archaeology from post-determinative excavation in Southwest England?
* How many research [investigations](ld4he-investigation.md) occurred in England in a given year?
* How many [geophysical surveys](ld4he-methodology.md) have been undertaken on a specific type of geology?
* How many [reports](ld4he-report.md) are there which fit a specific theme within a research framework?
