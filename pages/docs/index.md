# Linked Data for the Historic Environment (LD4HE)

## Project aims
The LD4HE project has the following aims and objectives:

* To create a mapping from mandatory OASIS fields to the CIDOC-CRM.
* To create a simple means of converting an OASIS data export to a Linked Data compatible format.
* To determine criteria for establishing which records should be included in Linked Data export.
* To recommend potential for creation and usage of Linked Data.

## Project scope
The LD4HE project scope is to create the capacity for mandatory OASIS metadata (see [list of mandatory fields](ld4he-fields.md)) to be exported in a Linked Data compatible format.This is mapping and export only, with no intention (at this stage) to make the output data publicly available (thus not Linked *Open* Data). There are no current plans for hosting the output data within a publicly available triple store. 

The LD4HE project will allow questions such as the following examples to be answered accurately:

* How many [reports](ld4he-report.md) have been produced with evidence of Roman archaeology from post-determinative excavation in Southwest England?
* How many research [investigations](ld4he-investigation.md) occurred in England in a given year?
* How many geophysical surveys have been undertaken on a specific type of geology?
* How many [reports](ld4he-report.md) are there which fit a specific theme within a research framework?

## Data model
The [data model](ld4he-model.md) to be used is based on a subset of the [CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/). The following pages give further details of distinct aspects of the LD4HE data model:

* [Overall data model](ld4he-model.md)
	* [Dataset](ld4he-dataset.md)
	* [Record](ld4he-record.md)  
	* [Investigation](ld4he-investigation.md)
	* [Organization](ld4he-organization.md)
	* [Site](ld4he-site.md)
	* [Report](ld4he-report.md)
	* [Time Span](ld4he-timespan.md)  
	* [Artefact](ld4he-artefact.md)
	* [Monument](ld4he-monument.md)
	* [Person](ld4he-person.md)
