# Investigation
***

A [record](ld4he-record.md) refers to investigation activities taking place on a [site](ld4he-site.md). The investigation will have a title - often describing the type of event and the site (e.g. "[Event type] at [Site name]" - "Field Survey at Studfield Hill" etc.). There will be a stated [reason](ld4he-investigation-reason.md) for the investigation, which is carried out by an [organization](ld4he-organization.md) during a specific [time-span](ld4he-timespan.md). The investigative activity uses a [methodology](ld4he-methodology.md)
