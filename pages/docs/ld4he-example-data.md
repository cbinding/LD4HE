# Example Data
***
This page illustrates the format of the data as exported from the OASIS dataset. The [data fields](ld4he-fields.md) identified to be mapped as part of the LD4HE project are a subset of the full OASIS data structure. The following example is a single JSON record illustrating the data structure of the JSON data export format. 

```JSON
{!oasis_export.json!}
```
