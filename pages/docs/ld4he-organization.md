# Organization
***

An organization is any group involved in activities described in the data - such as [investigations](ld4he-investigation.md), or [report publication](ld4he-report-publication.md). An organization is identified by a [name](ld4he-organization-name.md), although this name is not guaranteed to be unique so should not be relied on as a unique identifier.
